Set up a local development environment: Install a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and PHP on your local machine. There are packages available like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP that provide a bundled solution for local development.

Create a project directory: Once your local development environment is set up, create a directory for your project. For example, you can create a folder named "test" in the web server's document root directory.

Clone the repository: Clone the repository containing the desired content to your local machine. You can use Git to clone the repository by running the following command in the command line:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/wisamsh/flashyapp-test.git
Copy repository content: Copy the content from the cloned repository to your "test" project directory. This can be done by copying the files and folders from the repository's directory to your project directory.

Access the project in the browser: Start your local web server and navigate to the URL corresponding to your project directory. In this case, it would be something like http://localhost/test. You should be able to view the project in your browser.

Remember to configure your web server correctly to serve PHP files if your project contains PHP scripts.
